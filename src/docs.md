Private key <- Unique, random.
Public Key <- Unique for private key, generated from private key.
Public Address <- Unique, generated by hashing (SHA-256) the public key.

Transaction Inputs: 
    UTXO referenced by transaction hash with sequence number in the blockchain.
    Unlocking script (scriptSig) which satifies the conditions for the UTXO to be spent i.e. unlocks the UTXO statisfy tge locking script (puzzle) to spend it.

    txid: transaction hash
    vout: index of the UTXO from the above transaction
    scriptSig: Unlocking script (scriptSig)
    sequence: index of the UTXO in blockchain

Transaction Outputs:
    Locking script (scriptPubKey) which locks the transactions with a cryptographic puzzle to be spent by only the solver of the script. Generally, locking script is the public address of the recepient (hash of their public key).

    value: Bitcoin value (for JSON encoding), generally denoted as satoshis during transaction
    scriptPubKey: Locking script (cryptographic puzzle), mostly public address of the recepient

Unlocking script is created by the wallet for satisfying the locking conditions for the UTXO to be spent.

Validating software (wallet) will retrieve the unlocking script from the inputs (vin) from transaction and fetch the locking script from the transactions referenced in the inputs (vin). Then execute the unlocking+locking scripts together and checks whether that condition results true or false.

Digital Signature (ECDSA)
Sig = F_sig(F_hash(m), dA)

    dA = user's private key
    m = transaction (or parts of it)
    F_hash = hashing function
    F_sig = signing algorithm
    Sig = Signature

Signature (Sig) is composed of two values R & S:
    Sig = (R, S)

Both R & S is serialized by DER encoding (Distinguished Encoding Rule).
